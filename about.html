This is a ticketing suite which is also called an ITS or Issue Tracking System. This is used to maintain and keep track of
issues pertaining to a certain topic or combination of topics. This project is maintained by Chris Marotta whom you can
find on github at <a href="https://github.com/TheRealChrisM/"> click me </a>. This was a project originally created so
that I could learn how to use html and make websites but also to create a strong but also user friendly ticketing system
that can be used in a multitude of different environments!
